      <p>Welcome!</p>

      <p>
        Several <a href="http://sog.gy">soggy</a> regulars are in the process of
        starting a hackerspace in Medford. The Rogue Hack Lab will be a
        community-operated, 24-hour space and infrastructure provider for
        technical and creative projects and events. We share a deep, totally
        unfounded suspicion that if we create the space, awesome people will
        come do awesome stuff with us there :)
      </p>

      <p>
        The space will open near downtown Medford this spring. Bootstrap
        infrastructure will include clean, comfortable work areas, a great
        network, whiteboards, a break area and a few tools. Project ideas
        include 3D printing, telepresence hacks, and software. Event ideas
        include programming classes, co-working days, and movie nights.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lab will be non-profit, funded mainly by member fees. We expect
        that membership will cost between $50 and $75 per month, and we'll
        have a student-slash-hardship rate around $20 per month. Membership
        means: 24/7 access to the space, the ability to host events, and
        participation in decisions about how we allocate resources.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, we're looking for people who are willing to commit (just a
        virtual handshake, nothing more!) to membership at those prices. If
        you're interested, but on the fence for one reason or another -- price
        too high? need to see it first? etc. -- we'd also like to hear from
        you. All of this is to help gauge interest and SWAG how much space and
        budget to plan for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally: if you want to take an active role in making this happen, we
        could absolutely use your help!
      </p>
