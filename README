make this repo available via the path /home/rhl-site.

You will need to set several environment variables. Currently this is done
manually -- the information you need to do this for the live server is all in
the 'secrets' encrypted file. You'll need:

 WIKI_DB_PASSWORD
 WIKI_SECRET_KEY

Once those are set, run:

 sudo chef-solo -c lab-solo.rb -j lab-node.json
